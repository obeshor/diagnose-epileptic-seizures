Diagnose epileptic seizures by using different Deep learning algorithms

The aim of this study is to diagnose epileptic seizures by using different machine learning algorithms. For this purpose, the frequency components of the EEG are extracted by using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and parametric methods based on autoregressive (AR) model. We use ANN, CNN and LSTM
